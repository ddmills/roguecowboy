Overworld map generation features
1. Points of interest (POI's)
2. Biomes
3. Rivers, Roads, Railroads
4. Bridges
5. Temperature
6. Faction ownership
7. Continuity across zones
8. Connectivity for roads/etc
9. uniqueness in zones
10. zones can have multi-z level structures (tall buildings, basements)

Underground can have rivers, mine carts, railroads, etc.

Each chunk should track:

- Biome on south-western corner
- southern edge connectsion
- western edge connections
- southern edge tiles
- western edge tiles
- stairs going _down_ (?)

For example, if this is a chunk:

+-    -    -    -    -    -    -+
1                               .
0                               .
p              s                .
0                               .
1                               .
0                               .
M00111011010p1110010001001r00110+


M = Mountain Biome
r = a railroad connection
p = a footpath connection
s = a down stair
0 = open
1 = blocked


We track the _corner_ so we can make the transitions smoother.
I.e, if the Western side is desert, and the easter side is mountain,
we know that this chunk needs to smoothly transition between the two.
If all four corners are the same (all desert), then we know this chunk
is entirely desert, and no transition is needed.

To generate the chunk, we must know the following data:

1. the edge position of every river/road/railroad
2. the biome of every corner
3. any stairs going _down_
4. any stairs going _up_
5. the point of interest type 
6. the faction in every corner.
